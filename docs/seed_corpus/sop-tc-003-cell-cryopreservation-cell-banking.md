# Cell cryopreservation — Cell banking (adherent mammalian cells)

## Purpose
Create stable frozen stocks of adherent mammalian cells for short-term backup and long-term cell banking, with high post-thaw recovery.

## Scope
- Applies to adherent mammalian cell lines grown in standard tissue-culture vessels (e.g., T-flasks, plates).
- Assumes aseptic technique in a certified biosafety cabinet (BSC).
- Cell-line–specific requirements (freezing medium, detachment reagent, seeding density, ROCK inhibitor, etc.) override this SOP.

## Safety
- Follow your site’s biosafety level, waste disposal, and decontamination procedures.
- Wear appropriate PPE (lab coat, gloves, eye protection).
- Cryogen hazards: use cryo-gloves/face protection when handling LN₂; risk of cold burns/asphyxiation.
- DMSO is readily absorbed through skin—avoid contact and wipe spills promptly.

## Materials

### Reagents
- Complete growth medium (as used for routine culture)
- DPBS (optional; per cell-line/lab practice)
- Detachment reagent (cell-line–appropriate): Trypsin-EDTA, TrypLE, Accutase, etc.
- Freezing medium (choose one):
  - Freshly prepared: complete medium + **5–10% (v/v) DMSO** (cell-line dependent), or
  - Commercial freezing medium (per vendor)
- 70% ethanol

### Consumables
- 15 mL / 50 mL conical tubes (appropriate size)
- Serological pipettes + pipette aid
- Cryovials (sterile, external-thread preferred for LN₂ use)
- Labels or cryo-safe marker

### Equipment
- Certified BSC
- Aspirator (or pipettes for media removal)
- Centrifuge (swinging bucket or fixed-angle)
- Cell counter (hemocytometer or automated) + trypan blue (or equivalent viability assay)
- Controlled-rate freezing device (e.g., Mr. Frosty / CoolCell) **or** programmable controlled-rate freezer
- −80 °C freezer
- Liquid nitrogen storage (preferably vapor phase) for long-term storage

## Preparation
- Pre-warm complete medium to 37 °C (and DPBS if you warm it).
- Pre-label cryovials **before** detaching cells:
  - Cell line, passage #, date, freezing medium, cells/vial (or concentration), operator/initials (optional), project ID (optional).
- Prepare freezing medium **fresh** the day of freezing when possible:
  - Many lines use **5–10% DMSO**; confirm the optimal % for your cell line.
- If using an isopropanol freezing container, confirm it’s properly filled/maintained per manufacturer instructions.
- Prepare the BSC: wipe down with 70% ethanol; set up waste, pipettes, conical tubes, and labeled cryovials **before** detaching.
- Recommended best practice: confirm culture is **mycoplasma-negative** prior to banking.

## Procedure
1. Inspect the culture flask under the microscope to confirm healthy morphology and no signs of contamination. Target confluency is usually **~70–80%** (or your cell-line norm).

2. Remove spent medium by aspirating (preferred) or carefully pipetting it off without disturbing the monolayer.

3. **Optional (cell-line dependent):** Rinse once with DPBS to remove residual serum (can improve detachment for some lines), then aspirate.

4. Add detachment reagent to just cover the surface, then incubate (typically 2–5 min at 37 °C; varies by cell line/reagent).

5. Tap gently and confirm detachment under the microscope. If needed, extend the incubation in short increments.

6. Add complete medium to neutralize the detachment reagent (for trypsin, use **at least an equal volume** of medium; serum-free systems may differ).

7. Pipette gently to create a single-cell suspension, then transfer it to a labeled conical tube.

8. Remove an aliquot (e.g., 100–200 µL) for cell count and viability. Proceed if viability is acceptable (commonly **≥90%** for robust recovery).

9. Centrifuge at **~200–300 × g for ~5 min** (adjust per cell type and lab practice).

10. Aspirate the supernatant gently without disturbing the pellet.

11. Resuspend the pellet in **pre-cooled freezing medium** (2–8 °C is commonly used) to a target concentration of **1–5 × 10⁶ viable cells/mL** (typical range; optimize per line).

12. Mix gently but thoroughly to keep the suspension homogeneous.

13. Dispense **1.0 mL** of cell suspension into each cryovial (or per your lab standard).

14. Place vials into a controlled-rate freezing container (or programmable freezer) to achieve ~**1 °C/min** cooling.

15. Place the container at **−80 °C overnight (≈12–24 h)**.

16. For long-term storage, transfer vials to **liquid nitrogen** (vapor phase preferred) **after at least 12–24 h at −80 °C** (i.e., once fully frozen).


### Storage guidance
- Best practice: use −80 °C as the controlled-freeze step, then transfer to LN₂ for long-term storage.
- If you must keep vials at −80 °C temporarily, follow your vendor/cell-line guidance; long-term stability is generally poorer than LN₂.

## QC checks / expected observations
- **Before freezing**
  - Confluency ~70–80%, healthy morphology, no contamination.
  - Viability typically **≥90%** (cell-line dependent).
- **After freezing (recommended for a “bank”)**
  - Thaw **one vial** after ≥24 hours in LN₂ to confirm:
    - Post-thaw viability (record it)
    - Expected morphology and growth rate
    - Mycoplasma-negative status (recommended)

## Troubleshooting
- **Low post-thaw viability**
  - Freezing rate too fast/too slow → use a controlled-rate container (~1 °C/min) and ensure it’s correctly prepared.
  - Cells sat too long in DMSO before freezing → aliquot quickly; keep cold; start freezing immediately.
  - Cells were over-confluent/stressed → freeze at healthier confluency; avoid nutrient depletion.
- **Cells clump during resuspension**
  - Incomplete detachment or harsh pipetting → optimize detachment time and use gentle trituration.
  - High DNA from dead cells → improve culture health; consider filtering for sensitive workflows (if allowed).
- **Poor attachment after thaw**
  - Cell-line specific (coatings/ROCK inhibitor/initial seeding density) → follow the line’s recommended recovery conditions.
- **Vial leaks/cracks**
  - Use cryovials rated for LN₂; avoid submerging vials in liquid phase unless validated; tighten caps consistently.

## Critical points
- Avoid freezing cells from **>90% confluency**; passage and freeze at ~70–80% for better recovery.
- **Controlled cooling (~1 °C/mi**
Once DMSO is added, **work quickly** (dispense and start freezing); prolonged exposure can reduce viability.
- Bank with good traceability: cell line, passage, date, medium composition, and location (rack/box/slot).
