# Incubator & hood best practices (asepsis + cleaning)

## Purpose
Maintain aseptic technique and reduce contamination risk in cell culture by defining routine best practices for:
- CO₂ incubators (inspection, handling, cleaning, and maintenance)
- Biosafety cabinets (BSCs) / tissue-culture hoods (aseptic workflow, cleaning, and airflow stabilization)

## Scope
- Applies to mammalian cell culture work performed in a certified BSC and stored in CO₂ incubators.
- Intended for routine best practices; follow your institution’s EHS policies and manufacturer instructions for deep decontamination, spills, or confirmed contamination events.

## Safety
- Follow your site’s biosafety level, waste disposal, and decontamination procedures (local rules take precedence).
- Wear appropriate PPE (lab coat, gloves, eye protection).
- Use disinfectants with appropriate contact time; avoid incompatible chemicals that may damage equipment.
- Bleach is corrosive to stainless steel; use only if approved and follow with an appropriate rinse/wipe per local guidance.

## Materials

### Disinfectants
- 70% ethanol (fresh, labeled spray bottle)
- Institution-approved disinfectant for periodic deep cleaning (per lab policy/manufacturer)

### Supplies
- Lint-free wipes/paper towels
- Secondary containment tray/bin for transporting cultures
- Sterile distilled water for incubator humidity pan (if applicable)
- Humidity pan antimicrobial additive **only if approved** by your lab/manufacturer (optional)
- Cleaning log sheet (paper or digital)

### Equipment
- CO₂ incubator(s)
- Certified BSC / tissue-culture hood
- Vacuum/aspiration system (as needed)
- Optional: mycoplasma testing supplies (per lab policy)

## Preparation
- Confirm the BSC certification sticker is current (within your institution’s required interval, commonly annual).
- Prepare fresh 70% ethanol in a labeled spray bottle.
- Verify the incubator setpoints/alarms are correct (temperature, CO₂, and humidity settings per incubator type).
- Ensure sterile distilled water is available for the incubator humidity pan (if used).
- Start or update the incubator and BSC cleaning logs for the current week/month.

## Procedure

### A) CO₂ incubator: daily aseptic use + quick checks
1. Visually inspect the incubator interior (walls, door, and gasket area) for spills, residue, condensation, or visible microbial growth.

2. Check incubator status readings (temperature, CO₂, and any alarms) and record exceptions.

3. Confirm the CO₂ supply is adequate (tank pressure/level or facility supply status).

4. Open the incubator door only as long as necessary and close it promptly.

5. Transport cultures in secondary containment between BSC and incubator.

6. Wipe the exterior of bottles/flasks introduced into the incubator (as needed per lab practice) to reduce carry-in contamination.

7. Wipe incubator exterior high-touch surfaces (handle/door area) with 70% ethanol.

### B) CO₂ incubator: weekly routine (recommended baseline)
1. Replace the humidity pan water with fresh sterile distilled water (if a humidity pan is used).

2. Clean the humidity pan before refilling (commonly wiped with 70% ethanol; follow your lab/manufacturer guidance).

3. Inspect and wipe the door gasket and door frame to remove residue where mold can develop.

4. Review incubator contents and remove unused/old cultures and unnecessary items.

### C) CO₂ incubator: scheduled cleaning (monthly or per lab policy)
1. Relocate active cultures to a backup incubator or minimize cultures during cleaning.

2. Turn off or place the incubator into a safe cleaning mode per the manufacturer’s instructions.

3. Remove shelves, racks, and the humidity pan.

4. Clean interior surfaces using mild detergent/approved cleaner as allowed by your policy.

5. Wipe interior surfaces with 70% ethanol and allow surfaces to air-dry.

6. Clean shelves/racks separately and return only when fully dry.

7. Reinstall components, refill humidity pan (if used), and allow the incubator to re-equilibrate to setpoints before returning cultures.

8. Document the cleaning in the incubator log (date, person, actions, and any issues found).

> Notes:
> - Do **not** spray ethanol directly onto incubator sensors/electronics; wipe carefully around them per guidance.
> - If your incubator has a built-in high-heat or H₂O₂ decontamination cycle, follow the manufacturer’s schedule and procedure.

### D) BSC: start-up and airflow stabilization (before aseptic work)
1. Turn on the BSC blower and lights (and ensure UV, if present, is OFF).

2. Set the sash to the correct operating height.

3. Allow the BSC to run to purge/stabilize airflow **before** starting work (commonly **≥5 minutes**, or per manufacturer/lab policy).

4. Wipe the interior work surface and side/back walls with 70% ethanol (or lab-approved disinfectant) and allow it to air-dry.

5. Place only necessary items into the BSC and arrange them to maintain a clear front grille and unobstructed airflow.

6. After placing your arms and materials into the cabinet, pause briefly before manipulating sterile items to allow airflow to stabilize.

### E) BSC: aseptic technique during work
1. Work at least several inches inside the cabinet (away from the front opening) to reduce disruption of the air curtain.

2. Move hands/arms slowly and minimize in-and-out motions.

3. Avoid blocking front and rear grilles with bottles, waste containers, or arms.

4. Organize workflow from “clean” to “dirty” to reduce cross-contamination.

5. Keep open containers covered as much as possible and avoid talking directly into the work area.

6. Disinfect gloved hands with 70% ethanol as needed (especially after touching non-sterile surfaces).

7. Keep the BSC uncluttered and avoid unnecessary paper/boxes inside the cabinet.

### F) BSC: end-of-work cleanup
1. Close or cap cultures and remove them to the incubator in secondary containment.

2. Dispose of waste appropriately (biohazard vs. sharps vs. chemical) per lab policy.

3. Wipe down the work surface and interior sides/back wall with 70% ethanol (or approved disinfectant) and allow it to air-dry.

4. Allow the BSC blower to run briefly after cleaning and before shutdown (or leave running continuously according to the lab’s standard).

5. Log any spills, contamination concerns, or maintenance issues and notify the supervisor as required.

> Deep cleaning note:
> - Some “enhanced”/below-deck hood cleaning procedures recommend a longer downtime before resuming work (e.g., **hours**) depending on what was disassembled/cleaned and local policy.

## QC checks / expected observations
- Incubator readings are stable and within setpoints; alarms are not active.
- No visible contamination in incubator (walls, gasket, water pan area) during daily checks.
- Humidity pan water is clean and replaced on schedule (if used).
- BSC interior surfaces are disinfected and dry before starting work.
- BSC grilles are unobstructed during work.
- Cleaning/maintenance logs are updated and traceable.

## Troubleshooting
- **Frequent incubator contamination**
  - Likely causes: contaminated water pan, dirty door gasket, frequent door opening, shared reagents brought in, overdue deep cleaning.
  - Actions: increase water-pan change frequency, clean gasket area, reduce door-open time, quarantine shared reagents, and schedule a full clean/decon cycle.

- **Excessive condensation in incubator**
  - Likely causes: overfilled water pan, frequent door opening, high room humidity, unstable temperature.
  - Actions: verify correct water level, reduce door openings, confirm temperature stability, and check door gasket seal.

- **BSC “turbulence” and poor sterility**
  - Likely causes: blocked grilles, rapid arm movement, too many items, sash at wrong height, insufficient purge/stabilization time.
  - Actions: clear grilles, declutter, slow movements, set sash correctly, and allow full purge/stabilization before starting.

- **Cells show poor recovery after routine passaging**
  - Likely causes: incubator drift (CO₂/temp), mycoplasma, harsh detachment, low seeding density.
  - Actions: verify incubator calibration, test for mycoplasma per policy, and review passaging parameters.

## Critical points
- Daily incubator visual inspection catches early mold/bacterial growth before it spreads.
- Use **70% ethanol** routinely for wiping incubator/BSC surfaces (per compatibility and local policy).
- Do not begin sterile manipulations in the BSC immediately after start-up/cleaning; allow airflow to purge/stabilize first.
- Keep BSC front/rear grilles unobstructed to maintain the protective air barrier.
- Minimize incubator door openings and always transport cultures in secondary containment.
- Keep simple, consistent logs (who/when/what) for incubator cleaning and BSC maintenance.
