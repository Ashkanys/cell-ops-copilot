# Thawing adherent cells

## Purpose
Thaw a cryopreserved adherent cell vial and seed cells into a tissue-culture flask under aseptic conditions.

## Scope
- Applies to adherent mammalian cell lines thawed from LN2 storage.
- Assumes standard biosafety cabinet (BSC) workflow.
- Centrifugation step may vary by cell line and freezing medium.

## Safety
- Follow local biosafety and waste disposal rules.
- Wear appropriate PPE and work in a certified BSC.

## Materials
- Complete growth medium (pre-warmed to 37 °C)
- DPBS (optional; pre-warmed or room temp per lab practice)
- 70% ethanol
- Conical tube (15 mL or 50 mL)
- Serological pipettes + pipette aid
- Tissue-culture flask (pre-labeled; coated if required)

## Preparation
- Pre-warm complete medium (and DPBS if used) to 37 °C.
- Prepare the BSC: labeled waste, pipettes, conical tube, and flask ready **before** retrieving the vial.
- Confirm flask coating/pre-treatment is completed and ready for seeding.
- Pre-fill a conical tube with pre-warmed medium (e.g., 9–10 mL) for dilution.

## Procedure
1. Retrieve the cryovial from LN2 and immediately place in a 37 °C water bath.
2. Thaw with gentle swirling until only a small ice crystal remains (do **not** over-thaw).
3. Remove the vial, wipe with 70% ethanol, and transfer into the BSC.
4. Gently resuspend by pipetting up/down to collect contents (avoid foaming).
5. Add the cell suspension **dropwise** into the pre-filled conical tube of warm medium to dilute DMSO.
6. **Optional (cell-line dependent):** Centrifuge at ~200–300 × g for ~5 minutes.
7. Inspect: confirm a pellet (if spun) and that the supernatant is relatively clear.
8. Carefully remove supernatant to waste without disturbing the pellet.
9. Gently resuspend in ~1 mL warm medium to make a single-cell suspension (minimize shear).
10. Transfer the suspension into the prepared flask.
11. Add warm medium to the final working volume for that flask size.
12. Gently rock the flask (front–back, left–right) to distribute cells evenly.
13. Place in a 37 °C, 5% CO₂ incubator.

## QC checks / expected observations
- ~1 hour post-seeding: many cells may be attached but still round.
- 8–12 hours: cells should begin spreading/elongating (cell-line dependent).
- Optional: take a small aliquot before seeding and assess count/viability (e.g., trypan blue).

## Troubleshooting
- **Low attachment after ~12 hours**
  - Likely causes: over-thawing, excessive mechanical stress, prolonged DMSO exposure, incorrect coating.
  - Actions: verify thaw timing, dilute DMSO promptly, use gentler pipetting, confirm coating and medium.
- **Cells attach but are very sparse**
  - Likely cause: seeding density too low / vessel too large.
  - Actions: move to a smaller vessel or concentrate cells (if available), or adjust seeding density next thaw.

## Critical points
- Minimize time in the water bath; check frequently once thawing begins.
- Dilute DMSO promptly after thaw; avoid delays between thaw and dilution.
- If centrifuging, remove supernatant gently to avoid losing the pellet.
- Resuspend gently to reduce shear stress and improve recovery.
