# Passaging adherent cells

## Purpose
Passage adherent mammalian cells from one tissue-culture vessel to another while maintaining healthy growth and consistent seeding density.

## Scope
- Applies to adherent mammalian cell lines grown in standard tissue-culture vessels.
- Assumes aseptic technique in a certified biosafety cabinet (BSC).
- Wash, detachment reagent, incubation time, and need for centrifugation are **cell-line dependent**.

## Safety
- Follow your site’s biosafety level, waste disposal, and decontamination procedures.
- Wear appropriate PPE and work in a certified BSC.
- Detachment reagents can be irritating; handle per SDS.

## Materials

### Reagents
- Complete growth medium (as used for routine culture; pre-warmed to 37 °C)
- DPBS or PBS **without Ca²⁺/Mg²⁺** (optional but commonly used before trypsinization) :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
- Detachment reagent (cell-line appropriate): Trypsin-EDTA, TrypLE, Accutase, etc.
- 70% ethanol

### Consumables
- 15 mL / 50 mL conical tubes (appropriate size)
- Serological pipettes + pipette aid
- Labels or cryo-safe marker
- Tissue-culture flask/plate (pre-labeled; coated if required)

### Equipment
- Certified BSC
- Aspirator (or pipettes for media removal)
- Centrifuge (optional; per cell line)
- Cell counter (hemocytometer or automated) + trypan blue (or equivalent viability assay)

## Preparation
- Pre-warm complete medium (and DPBS/PBS if used) to 37 °C.
- Prepare the BSC: disinfect the surface, and stage labeled waste, pipettes, conical tube(s), and the new culture vessel(s).
- Confirm the destination vessel coating/pre-treatment (if required) is complete and ready for seeding.
- Decide and document your target split ratio or seeding density per cell line (e.g., 1:3, 1:5, or cells/cm²). :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## Procedure
1. Inspect the culture vessel under the microscope to confirm healthy morphology and no signs of contamination, and record confluency (often passaged around **~70–80%**, cell-line dependent). :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

2. Remove spent medium by aspirating (preferred) or carefully pipetting it off without disturbing the monolayer.

3. **Optional (cell-line dependent):** Rinse the monolayer once with PBS/DPBS (commonly Ca²⁺/Mg²⁺-free) to remove residual serum, then aspirate. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

4. Add detachment reagent to just cover the cell layer (typical guidance for trypsin is ~**1 mL per 25 cm²**; adjust per vessel size and reagent instructions). :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

5. Incubate at 37 °C until cells begin to round up and detach (often ~2–5 min, but varies by cell line and reagent). :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

6. Gently tap the vessel and confirm detachment under the microscope, extending incubation in short increments only as needed.

7. Add complete medium to stop/neutralize detachment (for trypsin, use **at least an equal volume** of complete medium; follow reagent-specific guidance for TrypLE/Accutase and serum-free systems). :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

8. Gently pipette to produce a single-cell suspension, then transfer the cell suspension to a labeled conical tube.

9. Remove an aliquot (e.g., 100–200 µL) for cell count and viability.

10. **Optional (cell-line dependent):** Centrifuge the suspension at **~200–300 × g for ~5 min** to remove detachment reagent and spent medium. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

11. **If centrifuged:** Aspirate the supernatant gently without disturbing the pellet. Resuspend the cells in fresh complete medium to a homogeneous single-cell suspension.

12. Seed the destination vessel with the calculated volume to achieve the desired split ratio or seeding density.

13. Add warm complete medium to the final working volume appropriate for the vessel.

14. Gently rock the vessel (front–back, left–right) to distribute cells evenly.

15. Place the vessel in a 37 °C, 5% CO₂ incubator.

## QC checks / expected observations
- **Immediately after seeding:** cells may be round and not fully attached.
- **~1–4 hours:** many cell lines begin attaching; some remain partially rounded.
- **8–12 hours:** cells typically spread/elongate (cell-line dependent).
- **Next day:** culture should show even distribution (no dense “patches” unless expected for the line).

## Troubleshooting
- **Low detachment efficiency**
  - Likely causes: residual serum inhibiting trypsin, strongly adherent line, detachment reagent too weak/expired, insufficient incubation.
  - Actions: add/ensure PBS rinse(s), optimize reagent type/concentration and incubation time, and avoid prolonged harsh exposure. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}

- **Low viability after passaging**
  - Likely causes: over-trypsinization, harsh pipetting, culture stress/overconfluency.
  - Actions: shorten exposure, use gentler dissociation (e.g., Accutase/TrypLE where appropriate), and reduce shear during trituration. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}

- **Poor attachment after seeding**
  - Likely causes: incorrect coating, vessel not tissue-culture treated, seeding density too low, incomplete neutralization/removal of detachment reagent.
  - Actions: verify coating/treatment, increase seeding density, and use the centrifugation option if your line is sensitive to residual detachment reagent.

- **Uneven distribution (“cells in a corner”)**
  - Likely cause: swirling in a circular motion after seeding.
  - Actions: use gentle front–back and left–right rocking instead of circular swirling.

## Critical points
- Avoid letting cultures become overconfluent; many lines show slower recovery and altered behavior after prolonged overconfluency.
- Use PBS/DPBS rinses and detachment timing appropriate to the cell line; excessive exposure can reduce viability. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}
- Triturate gently to minimize shear stress and clumping.
- Record passage number, split ratio (or cells/cm²), vessel type, and date for traceability.
