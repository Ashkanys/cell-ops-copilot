# Thawing adherent cells

## Purpose
Thaw a cryopreserved adherent cell vial and seed cells into a tissue-culture flask under aseptic conditions.

## Scope
- Applies to adherent mammalian cell lines thawed from LN2 storage.
- Assumes standard biosafety cabinet (BSC) workflow.
- Centrifugation step may vary by cell line and freezing medium.

## Safety
- Follow local biosafety and waste disposal rules.
- Wear appropriate PPE and work in a certified BSC.

## Materials

### Reagents
- Complete growth medium (pre-warmed to 37 °C)
- DPBS/PBS (optional; per cell-line/lab practice)
- 70% ethanol

### Consumables
- Cryovial(s) of cells
- Conical tube (15 mL or 50 mL)
- Serological pipettes + pipette aid
- Tissue-culture flask (pre-labeled; coated if required)

### Equipment
- Certified BSC
- 37 °C water bath (or validated thawing device)
- Centrifuge (optional; cell-line dependent)
- Microscope
- Incubator (37 °C, 5% CO₂)

## Preparation
- Pre-warm complete medium to 37 °C.
- Pre-label the destination flask and confirm any coating/pre-treatment is complete.
- Prepare the BSC: disinfect the surface and stage labeled waste, pipettes, a conical tube, and the flask **before** retrieving the vial.
- Pre-fill a conical tube with **9–10 mL** of pre-warmed complete medium for dilution.

## Procedure
1. Retrieve the cryovial from LN₂ storage and immediately transport it to the culture room in appropriate secondary containment.

2. If the vial was stored in LN₂, ensure any trapped LN₂ can vent safely (per lab practice) before warming.

3. Thaw the vial in a 37 °C water bath while gently swirling until **only a small ice crystal remains**.

4. Remove the vial from the water bath promptly (do **not** over-thaw).

5. Wipe the outside of the vial thoroughly with 70% ethanol.

6. Transfer the vial into the BSC.

7. Gently resuspend the vial contents by pipetting up and down to collect all material (avoid foaming).

8. Add the thawed cell suspension **dropwise** into the pre-filled conical tube of warm medium to dilute DMSO.

9. Gently mix the diluted suspension by slow inversion or gentle pipetting.

10. **Optional (cell-line dependent):** Centrifuge at **~200 × g for 5–10 min** (or per cell-line/vendor guidance) to remove DMSO.

11. **If centrifuged:** Confirm a visible pellet and relatively clear supernatant.

12. **If centrifuged:** Remove the supernatant carefully without disturbing the pellet.

13. Resuspend cells in a small volume of warm complete medium (e.g., ~1 mL) to make a single-cell suspension.

14. Transfer the cell suspension into the prepared culture flask.

15. Add warm complete medium to the final working volume appropriate for the flask size.

16. Gently rock the flask (front–back, left–right) to distribute cells evenly.

17. Place the flask in a 37 °C, 5% CO₂ incubator.

## QC checks / expected observations
- Immediately post-seeding: cells may appear round and partially refractile.
- ~1 hour post-seeding: many cells may be attached but still round.
- 8–12 hours: cells typically begin spreading/elongating (cell-line dependent).
- Optional: assess cell count/viability from a small aliquot prior to seeding (e.g., trypan blue).

## Troubleshooting
- **Low attachment after ~12 hours**
  - Likely causes: over-thawing, excessive mechanical stress, prolonged DMSO exposure, incorrect coating.
  - Actions: verify thaw timing, dilute DMSO promptly, use gentler pipetting, confirm coating and medium.
- **Cells attach but are very sparse**
  - Likely cause: seeding density too low / vessel too large.
  - Actions: move to a smaller vessel or concentrate cells (if available), or adjust seeding density next thaw.
- **High debris / poor morphology**
  - Likely causes: poor cryostock quality, harsh handling, or contamination.
  - Actions: inspect carefully, consider mycoplasma testing per lab policy, and restart from a clean stock if needed.

## Critical points
- Thaw rapidly and stop at a **small ice crystal** to protect viability.
- Do **not** fully submerge the vial; avoid wetting the cap/threads.
- Dilute the thawed cells into warm medium **dropwise** to reduce osmotic shock.
- Minimize time cells spend in concentrated DMSO at warm temperatures; proceed efficiently from thaw → dilution → seed (and spin if used).
- If centrifuging, remove supernatant gently to avoid losing the pellet.
- Handle gently to minimize shear stress (avoid vigorous vortexing/foaming).
