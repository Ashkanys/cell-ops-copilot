# Media & reagent handling (cell culture)

## Purpose
Prevent contamination and preserve reagent performance by standardizing how cell-culture media, supplements, and reagents are received, labeled, stored, aliquoted, warmed, and used at the bench.

## Scope
- Applies to mammalian cell culture reagents used in a certified BSC (media, serum, supplements, buffers, dissociation reagents, antibiotics, cryoprotectants).
- Applies to shared and cell-line–dedicated reagents.
- Does not replace manufacturer instructions; vendor/storage requirements take precedence.

## Safety
- Follow your site’s biosafety level, waste disposal, and decontamination procedures.
- Wear appropriate PPE and use aseptic technique in a certified BSC.
- Follow SDS guidance for hazardous reagents (e.g., DMSO, antibiotics, bleach).

## Materials

### Consumables
- Sterile serological pipettes and pipette aid
- Sterile filtered pipette tips
- Sterile aliquot tubes (screw-cap recommended for freezing)
- Cryo-safe labels / marker
- Secondary containment tray/bin for transporting reagents

### Disinfectants
- 70% ethanol (for wiping bottle exteriors and BSC surfaces)

### Equipment
- Certified BSC
- Refrigerator (2–8 °C)
- Freezer (−20 °C) and/or (−80 °C) as required
- Water bath (37 °C) or warming bead bath (preferred by some labs)
- Temperature-monitored storage (recommended)

## Preparation
- Confirm storage temperatures and shelf-life for each reagent from the label/COA before first use.
- Label each bottle/tube with **date received**, **date opened**, **expiration date**, and **initials** (and **lot #** if not already captured elsewhere).
- Assign “shared” vs “cell-line–dedicated” status for high-risk items (e.g., media bottles, serum bottles, DPBS) and label accordingly.
- Pre-aliquot sterile tubes and labels for supplements that will be aliquoted after thaw.
- Prepare a simple reagent log (digital or paper) to track lots, open dates, and any contamination events.

## Procedure

### A) Receiving & first-time setup
1. Inspect all incoming reagents for damage, leaks, turbidity/precipitate (if unexpected), and correct temperature condition on arrival.

2. Record supplier, catalog #, lot #, date received, and storage requirement in the reagent log.

3. Store reagents immediately at the specified temperature (2–8 °C / −20 °C / −80 °C) and protect light-sensitive reagents (wrap/amber as needed).

4. If a reagent must be sterile-filtered after preparation (lab-made), filter through an appropriate sterile membrane and label as “sterile-filtered” with the filter size and date.

### B) Aseptic handling rules (every time)
1. Disinfect reagent container exteriors with 70% ethanol before bringing them into the BSC.

2. Use a **new sterile pipette/tip for every bottle entry** (do not reuse a pipette/tip across reagents or bottles).

3. Dispense liquids using sterile pipettes rather than pouring directly from stock bottles.

4. Keep caps closed when not actively pipetting and minimize bottle “open time” in the BSC.

5. Never return unused media/reagent from a working vessel back into the stock bottle.

6. Avoid touching bottle necks/cap interiors; if contact occurs, quarantine the bottle and notify the supervisor per lab policy.

### C) Media handling
1. Warm only the amount of complete medium needed for the session (commonly to 37 °C for routine feeding/passaging).

2. If using a water bath, prevent water contact with cap/neck (use secondary containment and avoid submerging caps).

3. Mix media gently after warming (avoid excessive foaming) and visually check for unexpected color change or turbidity.

4. Limit time that complete media sits warm; return the main bottle to 2–8 °C promptly after use.

5. If media is shared across users, consider using a dedicated “working bottle” to reduce repeated entries into the stock bottle.

### D) Serum handling (e.g., FBS)
1. Thaw frozen serum at **2–8 °C overnight** when possible.

2. Finish thawing in a 37 °C water bath only as long as needed while gently mixing to reduce solute gradients.

3. Aliquot thawed serum into sterile tubes to reduce repeated freeze–thaw cycles.

4. Store aliquots at the vendor-recommended temperature and track freeze–thaw count (if applicable).

### E) Supplements & additives (growth factors, antibiotics, glutamine, etc.)
1. Reconstitute supplements using sterile technique with the specified diluent and concentration.

2. Aliquot supplements into single-use or short-term volumes to avoid repeated freeze–thaw.

3. Store aliquots at the recommended temperature and protect light-sensitive reagents.

4. Add supplements to media using sterile technique and record the final formulation (what, how much, date made).

### F) Buffers & dissociation reagents (DPBS, trypsin/TrypLE/Accutase)
1. Use Ca²⁺/Mg²⁺-free PBS/DPBS when required for detachment workflows (cell-line dependent).

2. Warm dissociation reagents only if required by your protocol and do not leave warmed longer than necessary.

3. If a dissociation reagent is repeatedly used across lines, consider aliquoting into smaller sterile volumes to reduce contamination risk.

### G) Quarantine & discard rules
1. Immediately label and quarantine any reagent suspected of contamination (“QUARANTINE — DO NOT USE”) and notify the supervisor.

2. If contamination is confirmed or strongly suspected, discard per institutional biohazard procedure and document in the reagent log.

3. When a culture becomes contaminated, quarantine the **specific media bottle and any directly used reagents** associated with that culture session until assessed.

## QC checks / expected observations
- Media and reagents remain clear (unless intentionally cloudy), with no unexpected turbidity, particles, or fungal filaments.
- pH indicator color remains within expected range for the medium and handling time.
- Reagent labels include open date, expiry, and lot, and logs are updated.
- No “shared bottle” is used across incompatible workflows or known contaminated lines.

## Troubleshooting
- **Frequent contamination in otherwise good technique**
  - Likely causes: shared stock bottles with many entries, non-aliquoted supplements repeatedly thawed, contaminated water bath, inconsistent bottle exterior wiping.
  - Actions: create dedicated working bottles, increase aliquoting, clean/maintain the water bath, and tighten BSC entry/exit rules.

- **Precipitate in media after warming**
  - Likely causes: incomplete mixing, overheating, serum precipitation from improper thawing.
  - Actions: warm gently, mix thoroughly, follow serum thaw guidance, and consult vendor guidance if persistent.

- **Reduced cell growth after media prep**
  - Likely causes: supplement degradation from repeated freeze–thaw, expired reagents, incorrect final concentrations.
  - Actions: aliquot supplements, verify dates/lot changes, and re-check calculations.

## Critical points
- Use sterile pipettes/tips and **do not pour** from stock bottles to reduce contamination risk.
- Minimize repeated bottle entries by aliquoting and using dedicated working bottles.
- Avoid repeated freeze–thaw by aliquoting serum and supplements.
- Label everything with open date, expiry, and lot for traceability.
- Never “top off” or return used material back into stock bottles.
