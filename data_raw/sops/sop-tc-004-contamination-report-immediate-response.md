# Contamination report + immediate response checklist (cell culture)

## Purpose
Provide a clear, immediate-response SOP for suspected or confirmed cell-culture contamination to:
- notify the lab supervisor/owner promptly,
- prevent spread to other cultures and shared reagents,
- dispose of contaminated materials safely,
- document the incident and corrective actions.

## Scope
- Applies to suspected contamination of mammalian cell cultures (adherent or suspension) handled in a certified BSC.
- Covers common contaminants (bacteria, fungi/yeast, mycoplasma, and cross-contamination).
- Does **not** replace institution-specific biosafety spill/exposure procedures; escalate per local EHS requirements.

## Safety
- Follow your site’s biosafety level, waste disposal, and decontamination procedures (EHS rules take precedence). 
- Wear appropriate PPE (lab coat, gloves, eye protection). Consider double-gloving for cleanup.
- Use appropriate disinfectant and contact time; longer contact times (e.g., 20–30 minutes) may be necessary depending on conditions and bioburden.
- Bleach can corrode stainless steel; follow with a compatible rinse/wipe (per local guidance).
- Flammable disinfectants (e.g., ethanol) may have restrictions in some BSC configurations; follow local guidance.

## Materials

### Disinfectants
- Freshly prepared **1:10 diluted household bleach** (typical practice) or other institution-approved disinfectant
- 70% ethanol **or** other approved follow-up wipe (per local guidance and cabinet type)

### Cleanup supplies
- Absorbent towels
- Biohazard bag(s)
- Secondary containment bin/tray for transport
- Forceps/tongs (if needed)
- Labels/marker (“CONTAMINATED — DO NOT USE”)

### Waste handling
- Access to approved biohazard waste stream (and sharps container if applicable)

## Preparation
- Identify your lab’s approved disinfectant(s) and required contact time(s) before an incident occurs.
- Keep spill/cleanup supplies stocked and accessible near the tissue-culture room/BSC.
- Ensure you know how to reach the lab supervisor/owner and EHS after hours.

## Procedure (immediate response + reporting)
1. Stop non-essential work immediately to reduce aerosol and cross-contamination risk.

2. Keep the BSC running and keep the sash at the correct working height (do not turn the cabinet off during cleanup).

3. Close the contaminated culture vessel securely (cap/close lid).

4. Clearly label the vessel **“CONTAMINATED — DO NOT OPEN”** with date/time and your initials.

5. Place the contaminated vessel into a sealed secondary container for isolation and transport.

6. Isolate all reagents directly used with that culture since the last confirmed “clean” check (e.g., shared media bottle, supplements, DPBS, trypsin/Accutase aliquots) by labeling **“QUARANTINE — DO NOT USE”**.

7. Notify the lab supervisor/owner immediately (and EHS if required by your lab policy).

8. Document the incident in the lab log (cell line, passage, vessel ID, incubator used, reagents used, contamination signs, and actions taken).

9. If safe and permitted, take a quick microscope photo for the record (avoid opening the vessel).

10. Remove all non-essential items from the BSC work surface to prepare for decontamination.

11. Wipe visible wet spots/residue inside the BSC with absorbent towels (avoid splashing).

12. Apply approved disinfectant (commonly **1:10 bleach**) to the affected BSC work area and any potentially contacted surfaces.

13. Allow disinfectant to remain wet for the required contact time (commonly **15–20 minutes** for 1:10 bleach in many institutional spill guides; follow your site’s requirement).

14. Dispose of used towels and disposable cleanup materials into the appropriate biohazard waste stream per your institution’s rules.

15. Wipe the BSC surfaces again with disinfectant, then remove bleach residue using an approved follow-up wipe/rinse (commonly 70% ethanol or water per local guidance) to reduce corrosion.

16. Disinfect the exterior surfaces of any items you must keep (pipette aids, bottle exteriors, racks) before returning them to service.

17. Dispose of the contaminated culture vessel as biohazard waste per institutional procedure (do not attempt to “rescue” unless your lab has an approved, documented exception process).

18. If your lab practice includes inactivating liquid culture waste with bleach, add disinfectant to reach the lab’s validated final concentration and contact time before disposal (follow site-specific rules).

19. Decontaminate any equipment potentially implicated (e.g., water bath, centrifuge rotor/buckets, microscope stage adapters) using institution-approved methods.

20. Evaluate whether the incubator used should be considered potentially exposed and follow your lab’s incubator cleaning policy if multiple cultures are at risk (especially for fungal contamination).

21. Identify “at-risk” cultures handled in the same session/BSC/incubator and flag them for increased monitoring and/or mycoplasma testing (per lab policy).

22. Wash hands thoroughly after cleanup and before leaving the tissue-culture area.

## QC checks / expected observations
- Contaminated materials are clearly labeled and segregated (no shared use).
- BSC work surface and contacted items have been disinfected with appropriate contact time.
- Lab supervisor/owner has been notified and the incident is recorded with enough detail to trace likely sources.

## Troubleshooting
- **Unsure whether it’s contamination vs. debris**
  - Action: quarantine the culture and monitor closely; do not keep using shared reagents until clarified.
- **Multiple cultures show signs**
  - Action: treat as a broader event. Quarantine shared media/reagents and consider incubator involvement.
- **Mycoplasma suspected**
  - Action: quarantine, test per lab policy, and strongly consider discard/restart from clean stock (common best practice guidance emphasizes discard when feasible). 

## Critical points
- **Notify the lab supervisor/owner immediately** and document what happened (traceability prevents repeat events).
- **Quarantine the culture and any directly used shared reagents** to prevent spread.
- **Use approved disinfectant and contact time**; many institutional guides specify ~15–20 minutes for 1:10 bleach for spill-type decontamination, but follow your site’s required time.
- **Bleach residue can corrode stainless steel**; follow with an approved rinse/wipe as directed by your institution/BSC guidance.
- If local rules differ (e.g., restrictions on ethanol use in certain BSC types), follow local EHS guidance.
